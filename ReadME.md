## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up and running the project for the first time.

### Prerequisites

List all software, tools, accounts, or permissions required before installation.

*   [e.g., Python 3.9+]
*   [e.g., Node.js v16+]
*   [e.g., Docker]
*   [e.g., AWS Account with specific IAM roles]
*   [e.g., API Key for service X]

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions to install the project and its dependencies.

```bash
# Example Installation Steps
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
npm install # or pip install -r requirements.txt, etc.
# Any other setup commands (e.g., database migrations)
```

### Running the Project
- **Backend:**  
  Start the FastAPI server:
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
- **Frontend:**  
  Open the `index.html` file in your browser to access the dashboard.

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage
- Use the dashboard for creating, editing, and deleting functions.
- Execute functions via the provided API endpoints.

### Advanced Usage
- Customize function execution by modifying timeout, language, etc.
- Integrate with external systems via REST API calls.

### Examples
- Example 1: Creating a new function.
- Example 2: Updating a function and observing changes in the Docker container execution.

<!-- ## Architecture -->

<!-- ### Overview Diagram (Optional) -->
<!-- ![Architecture Diagram](./architecture.png) -->

### Key Components
- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Containers:** Docker for function isolation  
- **Database:** SQLite (or any configured DB)

### Technology Stack
- Python, JavaScript, Docker, GitHub Actions

### Design Decisions
- Use Docker to encapsulate function execution.
- RESTful API for easy integration and scalability.

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- DATABASE_URL: Set the database connection string.
- Other variables as needed.

### Configuration Files
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- Dockerfiles for Python and JavaScript functions.
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.

---

## API Reference

### Endpoints
- GET `/functions/` : List all functions.
- POST `/functions/` : Create a new function.
- GET `/functions/{id}` : Retrieve a specific function.
- PUT `/functions/{id}` : Update a function.
- DELETE `/functions/{id}` : Delete a function.
- POST `/functions/{id}/execute` : Execute a function.
- POST `/functions/execute` : Execute multiple functions.

### Data Models
- **Function Model:** Includes name, route, language, timeout, and code_path.

### Authentication
- No authentication is implemented by default.
- Future enhancements may include JWT-based authentication.

---

## Development

### Setting up Development Environment
- Clone the repository and initialize your virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Running Tests
- Use your preferred testing framework pytest to write and run tests.

### Coding Standards
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python and standard JavaScript styling practices.

### Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes.

### Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repository, create a branch, make your changes, and open a pull request against the main branch.

---

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
- Build Docker images using provided Dockerfiles.
- Deploy using your preferred orchestration tool or cloud provider.

### Infrastructure
- Utilize Docker for container management.
- CI/CD pipeline configured via GitHub Actions.

### Monitoring
- Monitor application logs and container statuses.
- Use external monitoring tools as needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Docker not running: Ensure Docker is installed and started.
- API endpoints not responding: Check server logs and network configurations.

### FAQ
- **Q:** How to update function code?  
  **A:** Use the dashboard to edit and update function code.
